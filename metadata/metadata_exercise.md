## Structured metadata with schema exercise



We start by creating a `metadata.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
    "202207290140": {
        "map": [
            {
                "k": {
                    "string": "ToDo Item 1"
                },
                "v": {
                    "string": "Book Flight Tickets"
                }
            },        
            {
                "k": {
                    "string": "status"
                },
                "v": {
                    "string": "completed"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
